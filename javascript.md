## How JavaScript Works
 "Everything in JavaScript happens inside an **Execution Context**"

 ### **Execution Context:**

| Memory      | Code  |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Key: value  | 0     |
| a:10        | 0     |
| fn: {...}   | 0     |

- *Memory* also called Variable Environment
- *Code* is also called Thread of Execution

"JavaScript is *synchrouous* **single-threaded** language"
- *synchrouous* (when one command finish then go next command)
- **single-threaded** (execute one command at a time)
